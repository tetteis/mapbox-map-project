# Mapbox Map Project

Solution for the Mapbox Map project on [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online) course.

The goal of this project is to build a map using the Mapbox SDK and add a marker that displays a popup when you click on it.

To get this working you need to sign up on the [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/) website by clicking on the **Sign in** then **Sign up for Mapbox**. You will then find your access token on the page after your login, which will look something like this:

**pk.eyxxxxxxxxxxx...**

Replace the token with the dummy one supplied in the **"src/index.js"** file.

## Why Mapbox?

Ok, the reason Mapbox is used for this project is because it's free to get started and does NOT require you to enter your credit card details.

Have fun.
